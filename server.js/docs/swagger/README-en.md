## <h2 align="center">Swagger</h2>

By creating the documentation with Swagger, we were able to simplify not only the development of our API and the squad as a whole, but also the relationship with the other parts of the project (front-end squad, infra...).

### What is Swagger

Swagger is an interface description language for describing RESTful APIs expressed using JSON.
Swagger is used in conjunction with a set of open source software tools to design, build, document, and use RESTful web services.

Swagger is a framework composed of several tools that, regardless of language, help the description, consumption and visualization of services from a REST API.


### **Swagger allows you to create API documentation in 3 ways:**

1. Automatically: Simultaneously with the development of the API, the documentation is generated.

2. Manually: Allows the developer to freely write the API specifications and publish them later on their own server.

3. Codegen: Converts all annotations contained in the REST APIs source code into documentation.


### **Why use it?**

- ***Simple interface;***

- ***Organization of routes;***

- ***Performance of tests, without having to resort to other means;***

- ***API modeling;***

- ***Generation of API documentation;***

- **Client and Server code generation, with support for several programming languages.**
