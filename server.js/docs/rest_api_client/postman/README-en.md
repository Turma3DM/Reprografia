## POSTMAN

### <a name="WhatIsPostman"></a> What is Postman:

Postman is a tool that supports documentation of api requests. It has an environment for documentation, testing APIs, and requests in general.

By using it, you'll start working with APIs more efficiently, building requests quickly, and you can save them for later use, and you'll be able to analyze the responses sent by the API.

A good reason to use this tool is that through it, you can dramatically reduce the time required to test and develop APIs.

In a practical example, imagine that you want to make a GET request to look for certain information in the company name.

If this were the case with testing a GET request without using Postman, you would need to write all the code to execute the request, plus a visual interface to interact with this routine.

If granted, you would probably need to write all of this to create a functional application using this API, but all this work would simply be to test its functionality, which in fact, in this format, is tedious and time-consuming.

### <a name="WhyUsePostman"></a> Why use Postman ?

In addition to being a free and easy-to-learn application, with little time you will be sending your first requests (requests/ requests). In addition, it is a tool with broad support for all APIs and Schemas.

## <a name="ImportingACollection"></a> Importing a Collection:

#### 1. You can import from the home screen

![import6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71890228/142638750-ae4c91fd-1fc0-45f2-9456-d5956a4569d4.png)

#### 2. Now just click "Import" in the upper left corner of the screen

![import2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71890228/142635964-49db79fc-86d1-4797-8b3a-d84ccd63217c.png)

#### 3. Click "Upload files", or drag and drop the file that you want to import into the highlighted area, then click "Open"

To view the collection of Postman, [Click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Squad-Back-End/reprography-nodejs/master/docs/rest_api_client/postman/Reprography%20System.postman_collection.json) and then, right-click on the page and "save as".

Or use the collection already available within the folder docs/rest_api_client/postman when cloning the repository.

#### 4. Click "Import", then the available collections will appear in the left corner

#### 5. At the end a collection with the name of your file will appear (in my case, "Reprography System"), will be available

So we finished importing Collection via Postman.
